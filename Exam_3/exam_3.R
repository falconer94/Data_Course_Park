# 1. Do an analysis of the mtcars data set. That's right, our old friend mpg 
  # will be the dependent variable.
# 2. Do your analysis in an Rmarkdown document, complete with explanations 
  # for what is going on, 
  # what models you are trying, and 
  # figures showing predicted vs real data, etc.
# 3. Knit that Rmarkdown to an html file and add it to your website with 
  # a link that is easy for me to find on your page.
