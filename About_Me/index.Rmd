# About Me

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width= "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/Jeff (38).JPG")
```
<br><br>
I grew up in Northern Idaho near Spokane, WA, served a Spanish-speaking mission for my church in LA, married for four years, and almost have my bachelor's in biology from UVU.
<br><br>
I love learning new things, so I have a lot of hobbies. Some of my favorites (which I may not be currently participating in) are falconry, pets, music, and reading/writing sci-fi and fantasy.

My mental health has been a challenge for me for the last several years, but it has shaped me into a better person.
