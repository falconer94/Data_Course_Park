# About Me

<br><br>
Hi, I'm Jeff.
<br><br>
I grew up in Northern Idaho near Spokane, WA, served a Spanish-speaking mission for my church in LA, married for four years, and earned a bachelor's degree in biology from UVU. My passions are creativity, learning, faith, and family.
<br><br>
I'm excited about starting a career in data analysis or software development. While getting my bachelor's in biology, I grew curious---even passionate---about data and the power it contains to uncover the truth. I took a class on R and got hooked. I love the challenge in programming and writing script, learning how to solve numerous problems in different ways, and creating something that's almost living.
<br><br>
As part of my passions in creativity and learning, I have picked up a lot of hobbies over the years:
<br><br>
🦅Falconry
🎨oil painting
🎸🎤music
📖sci-fi/fantasy writing
🌻gardening
🏞️terrarium building
🐕🦜🐸🦎 pet keeping.
