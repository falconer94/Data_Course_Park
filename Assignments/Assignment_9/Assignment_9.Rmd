Data: Grad School Admissions

```{r}
df <- read.csv("GradSchool_Admissions.csv")
df$admit <- as.logical(df$admit)
df$rank <- as.factor(df$rank)
```

Mods

```{r}
mod1 <- glm(data = df, formula = admit ~ rank)
mod2 <- glm(data = df, formula = admit ~ rank + gre + gpa,family = "binomial")
mod3 <- glm(data = df, formula = admit ~ rank * gre * gpa,family = "binomial")
mean(residuals(mod2)^2)
mean(residuals(mod3)^2)
```

Mod3 has lowest MSE

```{r}
mod3.pred <- add_predictions(df,mod3,type = "response")
```

Admit has a stronger correlation with Rank than GPA or GRE score. 

```{r}
ggplot(mod3.pred, aes(x=gpa,y=pred,color=rank))+
  geom_point()
```


```{r}

ggplot(mod3.pred,aes(x=gre,y=pred,color=rank))+
  geom_point()
```

Conclusion:

The grad schools considered are more concerned about the university rank of the undergraduates than their GRE score or GPA.
